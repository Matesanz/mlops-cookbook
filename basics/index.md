# What is MLFlow?

Remember that **you are a scientist** (of data), and as a good scientist, you should keep a record of all your experiments. Well, **imagine MLflow as a book where you can jot down all your progress**.

For example, imagine you are trying to develop a model that predicts the price of a house based on a series of parameters like the year of construction or the square footage. As a data scientist, your job is to research and experiment with different approaches to build an accurate model. This is very much like a writer working on their book.
