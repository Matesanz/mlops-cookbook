# MLFlow Registry

The [Model Registry](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html) is a hub where you can find the models that you have trained and saved as "final" models. It is a place where you can keep track of the different versions of your models, and it allows you to compare them, share them, and deploy them.

Models can be registered in two ways:

1. **Using the UI**: You can register a model using the MLflow Web Intergace. This is useful when you want to manually register a model.
2. **Using the API**: You can register a model using the MLflow API (using python code). This is useful when you want to automate the process of registering a model.
