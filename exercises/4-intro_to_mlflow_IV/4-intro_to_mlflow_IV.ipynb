    "Where `<model_name>` is the name of the model and `<model_version>` is the version of the model you want to deploy. You can find the name and version of the model in the MLFlow UI. Also the `--port` argument is the port where the server will be running. It's important to choose a port different than the `5000` port where the MLFlow server is running. The `--env-manager` argument is the environment manager that MLFlow will use to run the model. In this case, we are using `conda` but you can use `pip` or `docker` as well."
