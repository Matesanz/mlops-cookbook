    "An \"experiment\" in MLflow is **like a specific chapter in your research book**. It's an organized set of steps and records that detail how you've tested a particular approach in your machine learning project. Each experiment in MLflow includes the code you've used, the configured parameters, the input data, the results obtained, and any additional notes you want to add.\n",

    "For example, if you are developing a model to predict house prices, an experiment in MLflow might involve training the model with a specific dataset, adjusting parameters like the number of trees in a random forest model, recording performance metrics like mean squared error (MSE), and making notes about any significant observations. Every time you try a different set of parameters or data, or even change the algorithm, you can create a new experiment in MLflow to maintain a clear record of your research and results. This makes it easier to track your progress and make informed decisions in your machine learning project."
